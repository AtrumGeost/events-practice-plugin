# A plugin to practice and apply my developer knowledge

This is a plugin that serves as a playground to try and learn new things. This is my first WordPress plugin that looks into WP Development concepts like:
- Custom Post Types
- The WP DB Class
- Extending WP_List_Table Class
- WP Filters and Hooks
- Object Oriented Programming in WordPress
- WP Coding Standards and Documentation
- Debugging
- Github and Git workflows
- Refactoring and the DRI (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle

## Setup

This is a basic plugin so there are no dependencies that need to be installed.
